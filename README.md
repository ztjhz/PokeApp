## Features

1. Has user authentication (login/sign-up) mechanisms

   - Utilized `Djoser` and `JWTAuthentication`
   - Each user has to login with a `username` and `password`

2. Allows users to view the current portfolio of pokemon they own and their stats

   - Each pokemon may only be owned by a single user and identified by its unique `ID`
   - Each owner may own any number of pokemon
   - Each pokemon has a (int) `level` `1-100` that is randomly generated upon capture

3. Allows users to add newly captured pokemon to their portfolio, and remove pokemon from their portfolio
   - Show a randomly generated pokemon from the dataset (from the list of all pokemons), available for capture
   - To capture, we implement a simple ‚Äúguess the number‚Äù game (see https://www.funbrain.com/games/guess-the-number)
   - If the user correctly guesses the number within 3 tries, the pokemon is captured, and added to the user‚Äôs portfolio
   - If the user is not able to guess the number within 3 tries, the pokemon is returned to the wild, the page is refreshed, and a new game instance is generated (with new randomly generated pokemon)
4. Allows users to view the names of pokemons they do not own yet (only names, not the stats)
